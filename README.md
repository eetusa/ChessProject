# ChessProject
A chess project as a practice to learn C#, Windows Forms and simple AI.

# Features
Currently the engine has all chess logics, can load up boards from fen and has random AI.

# Testing
The engine has perft tests and can compare the results with Stockfish UCI. 

# To Do

AI
Next up will be a simple minimax algorithm as AI. Alpha-beta pruning will be added, and maybe iterative minimax algo.
Evaluating the moves will be honed.

Performance
If performance proofs itself poor on the AI (it probably will), performance must be tweaked. Finding the legal moves is too expensive at this moment and can be optimized a lot.
